Summmary
This project presents a comprehensive computational analysis of the Mus musculus (house mouse) beta-globin gene complex, a 55 kb genomic region containing five functional genes ($\epsilon y$, $\beta h0$, $\beta h1$, $\beta 1$, and $\beta 2$) and two pseudogenes ($\psi \beta h2$ and $\psi \beta h3$)2. Using an integrated bioinformatics pipeline, I identified the primary coding sequences (ORFs) and analyzed their mRNA secondary structures to determine stability and regulatory UTR motifs3333. The protein analysis focused on the physiochemical properties and conserved globin domains essential for oxygen transport, while phylogenetic modeling illustrated the evolutionary divergence of these paralogs within the Muridae family4444. Subcellular localization and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks further elucidated how these proteins integrate into the hemoglobin tetramer to facilitate systemic oxygenation5555. This study demonstrates the power of in silico tools in characterizing complex gene clusters and their evolutionary history.
